    <h2>Improving employee efficiency</h2>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Eyowo's wallet system limited our ability to serve evolving customer needs and compete in the growing digital banking market. To address this challenge, we planned to develop an internal admin tool that would streamline the transition to our new Eyowo digital bank, empowering informed product decisions to enhance customer financial behaviour.</p>

    <h3> Problem</h3>
    <p>
        The old legacy admin dashboard hinders the Eyowo team's ability to make data-driven decisions and optimise workflows. Team members lack access to robust insights within the dashboard, forcing them to rely on external tools and other departments, leading to delays and reduced efficiency.
    </p>
    <h3>Impacts</h3>
    <p> ✅ 5% reduction in operational cost
        ✅ 50% reduction in transaction resolutions
        ✅ 50% reduction in fraud cases
        ✅ 80% reduction in downtime through transaction route</p>

        <li>User Research</li>
        <li>Workshop Facilitation</li>
        <li>Product Strategy</li>

       <h3>Team</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 x Product designer</li>
        <li>1 x Product manager</li>
        <li>3 x Engineers</li>
        <li>1 x CEO</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Duration</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>6 months</li>
       </ul>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>I started by conducting user interviews by speaking to 20 teammates from 8 departments to gain insight into their daily tasks while evaluating the limitations of the old admin dashboard through moderated usability sessions.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
           I facilitated a brainstorming workshop  with my product managers, engineers, and other stakeholders to ideate on “we might  empower our team to effectively carry out their tasks, based on the insight I gathered during research. <br>

            This collaborative effort resulted in the development of an internal tool designed to make data accessible, provide product support, and enhance team collaboration.</p>

        <h3>Making data accessible</h3>

         <p>
            The overview module offers users the ability to view activity trends within our ecosystem. I collaborated with a data analyst to simplify the data visualization section of the screen. Our primary objective was to communicate information clearly and concisely, ensuring easy comprehension by team members regardless of their professional background.

        <h3>Supporting customer-facing product</h3>

         <p>
            Our goal is to create an experience that empowers our customer facing product in order to help customers in achieving their goals and build a scalable platform capable of supporting  future value offerings. We implemented an additional security layer requiring customer authorisation and security checks so that our team can provide seamless support.

            <h3>Improving collaboration</h3>

            <p>
                The approval module fosters collaboration by enabling teams  to request and approve data within and across departments. I designed roles and permissions to empower team leads manage their team members' activities.

            <h3>Reporting growth and behavior</h3>

            <p>
                I designed a comprehensive report module to track business growth and product experience on our customer-facing product (Eyowo Bank). We collect data on customers, accounts, inclusion, and growth, continuously informing our efforts to improve our value offerings.
