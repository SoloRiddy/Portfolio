    <h1>Doula</h1>
    <h2>Easing pregnancy journey</h2>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Black women face a significantly higher risk—five to four times greater dying from pregnancy-related complications compared to other races. This disparity is influenced by racial bias in healthcare, including stereotypes about higher pain tolerance among Black individuals. <br>
        To address this issue, we created Doula, an app designed to support expecting mothers throughout their pregnancy journey. </p>

    <h3> Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Pregnant women often lack access to essential information to navigate their pregnancy journey smoothly and face challenges in effectively communicating their pain to healthcare providers. 
    </p>
    <h3>Impacts</h3>
    <p>✅ While surveys can be helpful, they shouldn't be the sole    source of information for making important decisions
        ✅ Demographics and psychographics are both crucial for a      comprehensive understanding of your target audience
        ✅ There's more to accessibility than just colour contrast</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>We conducted a semi-structured study with 3 mothers, 5 pregnant women, and 2 midwives to understand their experiences navigating pregnancy. This provided insights that were used to develop personas, scenarios, and hierarchical task analysis to explore the problem space in depth and recommend solutions that fit different user segments and use cases.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            We created a solution that empowers pregnant women to manage their physical and emotional well-being throughout pregnancy, connect with experienced mothers to gain insights into common struggles, and access reliable information about the delivery process and healthy baby development.</p>
       
    
        
        <h3>Assisting pregnancy journey</h3>

         <p>
            Our home screen allows users to track their daily activities to improve their physical and mental well-being. <br>

            They can also get first-hand information about their pregnancy symptoms with recommended reads on why and how to cope with them. We also gamify the experience to motivate users to complete their daily activities towards a healthy pregnancy journey.

        <h3>Improving physical and mental wellbeing</h3>

         <p>
            To improve the well-being, we grouped information into three (3) categories i.e. meditation, exercise and nutrition, which allow the user to be able to gain the support they need and also prepare them for child delivery

            <h3>Access to quality information</h3>

            <p>
                Our article section gives access to all the information needed to educate pregnant women and allow them to make intentional decisions around childbirth. <br>

                We also condensed the information into a story mode for a better reading experience.
